## What is ANKUSHA? ⚡

**ANKUSHA** is a single-file Bash dashboard for [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) HPC
clusters. It is not merely a script, but a manifestation—synthesising telemetry from
`squeue`, `sinfo`, `scontrol`, `sacct`, and `sprio` into one colour-coded,
terminal-width-aware screen. All with a **constant 10–11 Slurm calls per render**,
regardless of how many nodes your cluster has.

It operates entirely at the **user level**—no admin rights, no daemon installations, or
cluster configuration changes required. If you can whisper `squeue` to the scheduler, you
can command ANKUSHA.

## Why ANKUSHA Exists: The Three Sacred Purposes 🎯

While there are polished HPC monitors written in Python, Rust, and Go, ANKUSHA was
intentionally forged in pure Bash to fulfill three sacred duties that other tools cannot.

### 1. To Banish the Curse of Dependencies

In the hallowed halls of production HPC, a user is often shackled. Security policies
block `pip`. Module systems are fickle. Conda environments are forbidden luxuries.

**ANKUSHA requires no installation.** If you have a shell, you have a dashboard. Copy one
file. `chmod +x`. The ritual is complete.

### 2. To Uphold the Sanctity of Trust

In the digital realm, a binary is a black box. A Bash script is an open book.

- **Transparency:** A sysadmin can `cat ankusha.sh` and verify every Slurm call, every
  logic gate, every `eval`, in under five minutes. There is no obfuscation, no bytecode,
  no compiled mystery.
- **Zero Supply-Chain Risk:** No `pip install`, no `npm ci`, no `cargo build`. No
  transitive dependencies that could be poisoned by malevolent spirits upstream.
- **Portability:** It runs identically on a 15-year-old jump host and a modern
  head-node—free from the chaos of shared library conflicts or Python version mismatches.

### 3. To Avoid the Sin of the Naive Monitor

The common mantra of `watch squeue` is a simple sin, but a sin nonetheless. It hammers
the Slurm controller with redundant RPCs. When many users chant this mantra, the
`slurmctld` itself slows, and all suffer.

ANKUSHA walks the middle path: the **visual richness** of a compiled application with the
**lightweight footprint** of a native system utility—a feat achieved through
bulk-fetching, in-memory caching, and a constant call count that does not scale with
cluster size.

## The Sacred Scrolls (Requirements) 📜

| Tool                 | Purpose                       |  Required?  |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------- | :---------: |
| `bash` ≥ 4.0         | The language of the Goad      |     ✅      |
| `sinfo`, `squeue`    | Whispers to the scheduler     |     ✅      |
| `scontrol`           | Deeper inquiries to the nodes |     ✅      |
| `tput`               | The art of colour and light   |     ✅      |
| `awk`, `grep`, `sed` | The sacred text-carving tools |     ✅      |
| `sacct`, `sprio`     | Sages of history and destiny  | ⚪ Optional |

Fear not, Mahout. This is not a list of demands. These sacred tools are the ancient
spirits that already dwell within any Slurm-powered realm. We list them merely for the
sake of the unbeliever, as proof that no pilgrimage to the temple of `pip` is required.

**No Python. No Node.js. No Ruby. No Go. No browser. No pip. No conda.
No `module load`. No internet connection. No installation.**

---

## Summoning the Goad 🚀

```bash
# Clone the forge and summon the Goad immediately
git clone https://github.com/PSaiSurya/Ankusha.git
cd ankusha && chmod +x ankusha.sh
./ankusha.sh -p your_partition

# Or, place it on your sacred PATH for daily ritual
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cp ankusha.sh ~/.local/bin/ankusha
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

# The Goad now answers to your call. No pip. No conda. No further rites required.
ankusha --help
```

---

## The Mahout's Command Scroll 📖

The Command Scroll is your quick reference to the powerful incantations (command-line
options) that direct ANKUSHA's gaze.

```bash
ankusha                     # Glimpse the default pasture, your own herd
ankusha -p gpu              # Glimpse the 'gpu' pasture
ankusha -p highmem -u alice # Observe the herd of the mahout 'alice'
ankusha -i                  # Begin the Watchful Meditation (30s refresh)
ankusha -i 60 -p gpu        # Meditate upon 'gpu' (60s refresh)
ankusha -i 10               # A rapid meditation (warns, asks for intent)
ankusha --all               # Gaze upon all pastures of the realm
ankusha --tz UTC            # See time through the lens of the Prime Meridian
ankusha --help              # Unfurl the full command scroll
```

If the runes on this scroll prove cryptic, a more detailed scripture can be summoned
directly from the Goad with `ankusha --help`.

---

## Engraving the Goad: The Mahout's Personal Mark ⚙

A Mahout knows their beast, and a master knows their tools. While ANKUSHA is forged ready
for any cluster, you may engrave it with your own preferences. All defaults are defined
as read-only variables at the top of the script.

```bash
# --- THE TRIMMINGS (Change these for your own amusement) ---
readonly TOOL_NAME="ANKUSHA" # ← Go ahead. Rename it "Tusk-Tickler" or "Bob-Script".
                             # The Great Elephant will not judge your lack of poetry.
readonly TOOL_TAGLINE="The Goad of the Great White Elephant." # ← Or: "I swear to the Sysadmin I am not a DoS attack."
readonly VERSION="1.0" # ← Stay humble. The path to v9.0 is paved with hubris.

# --- THE ESSENTIALS (Truly useful engravings) ---
readonly DEFAULT_PARTITION="gpu" # ← Set this to the primary grazing grounds of your compute herd.
readonly DEFAULT_REFRESH=30 # ← The 'Sweet Spot'. 30s keeps the Admins' spirits calm.
readonly MIN_SAFE_REFRESH=30 # ← Crossing this line summons the "Are you certain?" spirit guide.
                             #   Note: this guard applies to interactive mode only. If you use
                             #   snapshot mode in a cron job, ensure your cron interval is also
                             #   >= 30s to avoid burdening slurmctld.
readonly DEFAULT_TZ="Asia/Kolkata" # ← Set to "UTC" or "America/New_York" for global mahouts.
```

---

## The Kavacha (Armor): Security Architecture 🛡

In the theatre of computation, trust is not given; it is proven. ANKUSHA's armor is
forged from principles of absolute minimalism.

### Zero Attack Surface

| Attack Surface                            | Status   |
| :---------------------------------------- | :------- |
| External packages (`pip`, `npm`, `cargo`) | ❌ None  |
| Compiled or binary components             | ❌ None  |
| Network connections at runtime            | ❌ None  |
| Write operations to the filesystem        | ❌ None  |
| Root or elevated privileges               | ❌ Never |
| Hardcoded credentials or tokens           | ❌ None  |
| External API calls or hidden telemetry    | ❌ None  |

### The One `eval` — An Inspected Join

A true Kavacha has no chinks. Therefore, let us inspect the one join in this armor. The
script contains exactly one `eval`. This is a standard, safe Bash idiom for returning
multiple values from a subshell. The `awk` program produces a fixed-format string of
integers. The output is validated against a strict integer pattern before `eval` ever
sees it. No user input or external data ever reaches it, making it immune to injection.

### Signal Safety and Clean Exit

The trap for `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGHUP`, and `EXIT` is registered at the **top level
of the script**, before `main()` is called. This guarantees that Ctrl+C at any point in
execution — including during argument parsing and partition validation — will always
restore the cursor, reset terminal colours, and reap the background `sleep` child before
exiting. No ghost processes. No hidden cursor. No corrupted terminal state.

### Audit It Yourself

```bash
# Read every line of the scripture before use
cat ankusha.sh | less

# Find every eval in the codebase (there is one)
grep -n 'eval' ankusha.sh

# Confirm zero calls to the outside world
grep -n 'curl\|wget\|nc\|ncat\|/dev/tcp' ankusha.sh

# Let the static analysis sage inspect its purity
shellcheck ankusha.sh
```

---

## The Vedic Mathematics of O(1) Silence 📊

> **The O(1) Principle:** While naive scripts burden the controller with a chaotic `O(N)`
> ritual, ANKUSHA remains unshakeable. It maintains a strict **10–11-call discipline**,
> ensuring the Cloud Mammoth never feels the weight of its rider—no matter how many tusks
> (nodes) the beast possesses.

### The Anatomy of Every Render

Every single render — snapshot or interactive frame — makes exactly the following Slurm
calls. This count is fixed. It does not grow with cluster size.

| Section                    | Slurm Tool | Purpose                                   | Calls  |
| :------------------------- | :--------- | :---------------------------------------- | :----: |
| `load_node_cache`          | `sinfo`    | Get node list for partition               |   1    |
| `load_node_cache`          | `scontrol` | Bulk-fetch all node metrics in one RPC    |   1    |
| `draw_quick_stats`         | `sinfo`    | Count node states (idle/alloc/mix/down)   |   1    |
| `draw_quick_stats`         | `squeue`   | Count running jobs                        |   1    |
| `draw_quick_stats`         | `squeue`   | Count pending jobs                        |   1    |
| `draw_nodes_section`       | `sinfo`    | Stream node list with state for rendering |   1    |
| `draw_jobs_section`        | `squeue`   | Fetch all active jobs in one call         |   1    |
| `draw_recent_jobs_section` | `sacct`    | Fetch last 7 days of completed jobs       |   1    |
| `draw_queue_section`       | `squeue`   | Fetch all pending jobs in one call        |   1    |
| `draw_queue_section`       | `sprio`    | Fetch priority scores for pending jobs    |   1    |
| **Total**                  |            |                                           | **10** |

> GPU totals in `draw_quick_stats` are computed directly from `NODE_CACHE` (already in
> memory from `load_node_cache`) — no additional Slurm call required.
>
> Job counts (`pt`, `pu`) in `draw_queue_section` are derived by parsing the single
> `squeue` result already fetched — no separate count calls.
>
> `sacct` and `sprio` are optional. If unavailable, those sections degrade gracefully
> and their calls are skipped, reducing the total to **8 calls per render**.

### Karmic Relief: The Impact of O(1) Discipline

| Cluster Magnitude | The Naive Clamour  | The ANKUSHA Silence | Scheduler Relief |
| :---------------- | :----------------: | :-----------------: | :--------------: |
| **10 Nodes**      |  34 calls/render   | **10 calls/render** |   71% Quieter    |
| **50 Nodes**      |  114 calls/render  | **10 calls/render** |   91% Quieter    |
| **100 Nodes**     |  214 calls/render  | **10 calls/render** |   95% Quieter    |
| **512 Nodes**     | 1,038 calls/render | **10 calls/render** |  99.0% Quieter   |

_Audit basis: static analysis of `ankusha.sh` source. Naive baseline = `14 + 2N`
calls (one `squeue` per node for state, one `sinfo` per node for metrics). ANKUSHA
baseline = 10 fixed calls regardless of N. Relief = `(naive − 10) / naive × 100`._

## The Origin Story: The Churning of the Silicon Ocean 🐘

In the ancient lore of the Vedas, the ocean of milk was churned to reveal a pristine,
multi-tusked white elephant—a celestial mount capable of carrying the heavens.

In our modern age, a new ocean was churned: an ocean of petabytes, qubits, and
floating-point operations. From this digital churning emerged the **"Cloud Mammoth"**—the
subcontinent's swiftest sovereign supercomputing peak and the Mythical White Elephant of
national science.

### The Tripartite Forge

Even a celestial beast needs a steady hand. To steer this national summit of compute, a
tripartite alliance of **Digital Alchemists** gathered to forge a tool worthy of the ride:

- 🧠 **The Mahout (The Human Architect)**: Defined the systems-security constraints and
  Slurm-safe batching protocols, field-tested on production national-scale hardware.
- ⚙ **Claude (The Anthropic Artisan)**: Provided the rigour of the script, ensuring
  every Bash line was as sharp and durable as a diamond-tipped tusk.
- ✨ **Gemini (The Google Visionary)**: Infused the interface with visual flair, adaptive
  layouts, and lore.

The result is **ANKUSHA** (_Sanskrit: अङ्कुश — the elephant goad_). It was forged not
merely as a script, but as a piece of mythology—born on a supercomputer to command any
cluster in the world with zero friction and zero load.

---

## The Dharma of the Forge (Contributing) 🤝

Contributions are welcome, but the Dharma of the Forge is strict and non-negotiable.

1. **Pure Bash only** — no new external dependencies, ever.
2. **Test on a real Slurm cluster** — not a mock or a container.
3. **Do not increase the fixed call count** — run the audit mentally before opening a PR.
4. **Update both v1 and v2** if logic changes — they share the same soul.
5. **Pass `shellcheck`** with zero warnings.
6. **Preserve signal safety** — the top-level trap and tracked `sleep` PID must remain
   intact. Never move the trap registration inside `main()`.

---

## The Mahout's Pact (License) ⚖

I chose the MIT License because a tool designed to guide a 1,000-tusked compute beast
shouldn't be held back by 1,000 lines of legalese. It is the "Universal Key" of the
open-source world.

While the law says you could technically scrub my name from the forge, we are both
scientists of the silicon. If **ANKUSHA** helps you tame your local mammoth:

- **Keep the Credits:** Let the "Synthetic Architects" (Claude & Gemini) and the Human
  Mahout keep their tiny corner of the script.
- **The "Karma" Star:** If this script saves your login node from a "Naive DoS" or helps
  you hit a paper deadline, toss a ⭐ to this repo. It's the only digital hay this
  elephant eats.
